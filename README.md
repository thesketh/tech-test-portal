Aire Logic tech tests for development candidates

## Instructions

If you're looking to join the growing team of talented individuals at Aire Logic you might have been asked to complete a technical test. The tech test is a chance for you to display you technical knowledge and show off best software engineering practice. At Aire Logic we work with a wide range of programming languages, technologies, frameworks and different types of software systems and so we understand that engineers often have particular areas of expertise. To cater for this wide array of possible skills we provide a number of different technical tests, we encourage candidates to find one that interests and suits their individual skill set (we may occaisionally suggest one, if we think it is appropriate). The general process for completing the tech test is the same for each test

- Read through the available tests and choose one that appeals to you
- Once you have chosen make sure you read through the instructions for that test thoroughly
- Create a public code repository for your submission
- Complete your submission in your own time
- Once you're happy, send a link to the public repository to our HR team

For junior developers, we have some simpler tests which require less boilerplate and cover more well-defined problems.

## Tips

 - Create your solution as though it was a production system, i.e. don't cut corners because it's "just a tech test"
 - If you are struggling for time, try to show examples of your skills and best engineering mindset and add comments to your readme to explain your process
 - Use your readme file to explain your thought processes and design ideas
 - If something is not clear, email us or raise an issue on the tech test via github
